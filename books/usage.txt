	title
		Given a search string S, prints a list of books whose titles contain S

		by title. If no search string is provided, all books will be printed.

		(case-insensitive). For each such author, prints a list of the author's 
		books. Authors are sorted alphabetically by surname. If there is a tie, 
		it will be broken by first/given name. If no search string is provided, 
		all authors will be printed.

	year
		Given a range of years A to B, prints a list of books published between 
		years A and B, inclusive. Books are printed in order of publication year. 
		Ties are broken by which title comes first alphabetically. If year A is 
		not provided, then any book published before or during year B is printed. 
		If year B is not provided, then any book published after or during year A 
		are printed. If neither year A or B are provided, all books are printed.

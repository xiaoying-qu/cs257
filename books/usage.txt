	title
		Given a search string S, prints a list of books whose titles contain S 
		(case-insensitive). Books are sorted by title or publication year as 
		specified. If no sort method is specified, books will default to be sorted 
		by title. If no search string is provided, all books will be printed.

		Given a search string S, prints a list of authors whose names contain S 
		(case-insensitive). For each such author, prints a list of the author's 
		books. Authors are sorted alphabetically by surname. If there is a tie, 
		it will be broken by first/given name. If no search string is provided, 
		all authors will be printed.

	year
		Given a range of years A to B, prints a list of books published between 
		years A and B, inclusive. Books are printed in order of publication year. 
		Ties are broken by which title comes first alphabetically. If year A is 
		not provided, then any book published before or during year B is printed. 
		If year B is not provided, then any book published after or during year A 
		are printed. If neither year A or B are provided, all books are printed.
		Note that to specify that no year is input, use the '_' character.

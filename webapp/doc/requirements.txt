STORY: Any car buyer who cares about fuel efficiency and wants to buy a vehicle built in 2022 can get a list of all the cars with certain features, so they can compare the fuel consumption in city and highway for those cars.

IMPLEMENTATION: we will have a menu with all the columns as sort parameters, each sort parameter has options of its own. For example, one sort parameter might be fuel consumption. The options for the fuel consumption field are city fuel (lowest to highest), city fuel (highest to lowest), highway fuel (low to high), highway fuel (high to low). These sort parameters can be applied individually, which means you can sort with two or more fields at once.

In this customer’s case, he can select the fuel consumption sort parameter and select city fuel (lowest to highest) option, this will give him a list of all the car models sorted from low to high by fuel consumption. If the customer is looking for other characteristics such as engine size or fuel type, he can apply more sort parameters to his search to find the car that best suited him.

IMPLEMENTATION: The same as the first two.






STORY: Car owner who suspects his neighbors have been stealing his gas, he wants to look up the city fuel consumption of his car model from our website and compare it to his gas money to make sure.
